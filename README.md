# Smart Bicycle Security

## Description
Smart Bicycle Security is an IoT-based system designed to help deter bicycle theft in neighborhoods. It uses a vibration and tilt sensor to detect unauthorized movement or tampering. When suspicious activity is detected, the system immediately sends an alert to the owner’s phone through mobile notification.

This solution is especially useful in the Philippines, where bicycles are a common mode of transportation and theft can occur frequently.
